Panel 1:
Narrator:
Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Sam. Sam loved to travel and explore the world. One day, he went to Mauritius to enjoy his summer at the beach. Sam swam a lot at the beach so he had to drink water. He grabbed his water bottle, finished it up, and carelessly threw it. Later on, he came across a little turtle. 
Dialogue:
Turtle: "Hi Sam", *sam looks confused that he understands the turtle* , Sam: "Hi there." 
Turtle: "I see that you threw your water bottle there, you see, us turtles are very sensitive to plastic and cannot stand it, we would really appreciate it if you would use more sustainable bottles for your water." 
Sam: "Thank you for informing me of this, I did not know this before."
