# Interactive-Comic
 
Project Name: Same's Adventure
Project Description: A comic following a young boy named Sam, who travels the world and learns about the effects of Global Warming from talking animals. The comic was done in the style of a children's book, and seeks to tackle a serious topic in an interactive and engaging way.
Process: My role was mainly to get everything implemented in the website. I first made a framework, and once we had the illustrations and dialogue ready I just put the pieces in their places and then spent some time getting the interaction to work.
Reflection/Evaluation: The whole process took a lot more time than I was prepared for, but it went well overall. I'm glad I was able to get the page-turning animation to work, since that was the feature I wanted the most and that also gave me a lot of trouble.

Dialogue:
Turtle: "Hi Sam", *sam looks confused that he understands the turtle* , Sam: "Hi there." 
Turtle: "I see that you threw your water bottle here, you know, us turtles are very sensitive to plastic and cannot stand it, we would really appreciate it if you would use more sustainable bottles for your water." 
Sam: "Thank you for informing me of this, I did not know this before."

Narrator: 
After a few days, Sam travelled to Australia. Sam loved camping so he went to the forest. As he was there, he came across a little deer.
