Project Transcription: 

Panel 1:
Narrator:
Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Sam. Sam loved to travel and explore the world. However, Sam was no ordinary boy. Sam had a special superpower that allowed him to understand and speak to animals. 

Panel 2:
Narrator:
One day, Sam went to Mauritius to enjoy his summer at the beach. Sam swam a lot at the beach so he had to drink water. He grabbed his water bottle, finished it up, and carelessly threw it. Later on, he came across a little turtle. 
Dialogue:
Turtle: "Hi Sam", *sam looks confused that he understands the turtle* , Sam: "Hi there." 
Turtle: "I see that you threw your water bottle there, you know, us turtles are very sensitive to plastic and cannot stand it, we would really appreciate it if you would use more sustainable bottles for your water." 
Sam: "Thank you for informing me of this, I did not know this before."

Panel 3:
Narrator: 
After a few days, Sam travelled to Australia. Sam loved camping so he went to the forest. As he was there, he came across a little deer.
Dialogue:
Deer: "Hi Sam", Sam: "Hi there."
Deer: "I see that you are making a campfire, you know, us deers are living here in the forest and are very exposed to forest fires. Please make sure that you take down the campfire after you are done with it as many people just leave it there."
Sam: "Thank you for informing me of this, I did not know this before."

Panel 4:
Narrator:
A few days later, Sam travelled to Antarctica. Sam loved skating so he went to skate. As he was there, he came across a little penguin. 
Dialogue:
Penguin: "Hi Sam", Sam: "Hi there." 
Penguin: "I see you are skating, that's very cool. You know, us penguins are living here in the glaciers and are very scared of global warming. I think that climate change is real and it is affecting us penguins since the sea levels are rising gradually. I would love it if you could tell your people back home to care more about the environment to help us all with this matter."
Sam: "Thank you for informing me of this, I did not know this before."
